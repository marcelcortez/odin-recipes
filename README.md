# Odin Recipes

## Project Overview
This project is part of the HTML practice exercises where we build a basic recipe website. The goal is to apply the fundamental HTML concepts learned, such as structuring web pages, using links, creating lists, and embedding images.

The website consists of a main index page that links to multiple individual recipe pages. By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated the ability to:

- Structure a webpage using HTML.
- Create and link multiple pages.
- Organize content with headings, paragraphs, lists, and images.

## Skills Demonstrated
- HTML5 basics.
- Building web pages using semantic HTML elements.
- Linking pages with relative paths.
- Structuring content using headings, lists, and images.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files and directories:


### Index Page (index.html)
The main page of the website contains links to all the individual recipes.

### Recipe Pages
Each recipe page includes:

- An `h1` tag with the recipe name.
- An image of the dish.
- A brief description of the recipe.
- A list of ingredients.
- A step-by-step guide to prepare the dish.
